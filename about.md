Hello, my name is Francisco (Paco) Lopez Lasanta and I’m a software engineer @ Ericsson (Spain).

Most of what I write here is about *software* and *DevOps*.

My (current) areas of interest are:

- MicroServices: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Netflix OSS...
- Docker: Engine, Machine, Compose, Swarm...
- Scala: Akka, Kafka, Spark...
- and Machine Learning in general

I am currently reading [Reactive Design Patterns (Kuhn, Allen)](https://www.manning.com/books/reactive-design-patterns) and [Advanced Analytics with Spark (Ryza, Laserson, Owen, Wils)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do).
_Next ones: [Streaming Architecture (Dunning & Friedman)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049463.do) and [Ansible: Up and Running (Hochstein)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035626.do)._

My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/flopezlasanta) and [Gist](https://gist.github.com/flopezlasanta), while my work history is on [LinkedIn](https://es.linkedin.com/in/flopezlasanta). My digital identity is on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/flopezlasanta).

I have a public key whose fingerprint is ```55A8 3CF8 344E 834A 3E00 ED65 3FD4 E16E 77EA DB72```.
