Hello, my name is Francisco (Paco) Lopez Lasanta and Iâ€™m a software engineer @ Ericsson (Spain).

Most of what I write here is about **software** and **DevOps**.

My areas of interest are:

- MicroServices: [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/), [Netflix OSS](https://netflix.github.io/)...
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Engine, Machine, Compose (v2!), Swarm...
- Scala: [Akka](http://akka.io/), [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/), [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)...
- and Machine Learning in general

I am currently reading (or planning to read) the following books:

- [ ] [Reactive Design Patterns (Kuhn, Allen)](https://www.manning.com/books/reactive-design-patterns)
- [ ] [Advanced Analytics with Spark (Ryza, Laserson, Owen, Wils)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035091.do)
- [x] [Streaming Architecture (Dunning & Friedman)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049463.do)
- [x] [Ansible: Up and Running (Hochstein)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035626.do)

My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/flopezlasanta) and [Gist](https://gist.github.com/flopezlasanta), while my work history is on [LinkedIn](https://es.linkedin.com/in/flopezlasanta). My digital identity is on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/flopezlasanta).

I have a public key whose fingerprint is ```55A8 3CF8 344E 834A 3E00 ED65 3FD4 E16E 77EA DB72```.
