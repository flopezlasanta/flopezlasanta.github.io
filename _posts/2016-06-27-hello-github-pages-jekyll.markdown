Creating (and maintaining) a blog about technical stuff is something I wanted to do since a long time ago. There are multiple options to do that: [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)... However lately I am using [GitHub](https://github.com/) quite a lot and because of that I ended up choosing [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The learning curve is really simple and they provide pretty much everything needed (to start with).

In this post, my first one, I'll share the steps I followed to create this blog using such tools. Note it's in a very early stage thus please don't be too hard (constructive comments are more than welcome!).

Basics
------

1. Create a new repository according to the guidelines mentioned in GitHub Pages _(tip: set .gitignore for Jekyll contents)_.
2. Install Jekyll in local.
3. Create a new Jekyll site using as site name the repository name.
4. Modify the file **_config.yml** with the site name and with your contact information.
5. Modify the file **about.md** with an introduction about you.
6. Add the Jekyll site to the repository following the steps mentioned in [Github > Add Project to Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).
6. Enjoy your recently created site browsing to its public URL.

Identity
--------
1. Add a file **robots.txt** to give instructions about the site to web robots, see [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html).
2. Add a file **keybase.txt** obtained from [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) _(requires to login with a Keybase account)_ to confirm the digital identity of the site owner.
3. Add a file **google65fe8dc7fdb34030.html** _(file name should be a different one)_ obtained from [Google Webmaster Central](https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification) _(requires to login with a Google account)_ to tell Google of the site ownership.
