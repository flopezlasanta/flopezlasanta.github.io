[GitHub](https://github.com/) is awesome for publishing code.

This post shares some common steps to consider when creating a development project / repository in there.

- Initialize with a ```README``` so that the repository can be cloned immediately
- Add ```.gitignore``` according to the technologies to be used
- Add a license according to the scope of the project (for instance [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT))
- Follow the standard directory layout based on the programming language used (for instance [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)'s for Java projects)
- Configure CI for your project with one of the proper [GitHub integrations](https://github.com/integrations/) (for instance [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/))
- Update ```README.md``` with the project description and getting started material (and use [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) for that)
- Update ```README.md``` with images from [shields.io](http://shields.io/) reporting about the CI status, license used, etc
